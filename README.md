# least_cost_trail

Computing least cost path (trail) from one start point to all possible end points (e.g., x=-6486.35675036, y=6748.63899645 to x=1158.18408741, y=6694.93027862; x=835.931780434, y=5047.86293184; x=-703.718130687, y=1628.40789667) given  already calculated friction map (e.g., 'fric'; time penaltiesâ€”added time to walk 1m)
